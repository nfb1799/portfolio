          technologies: 'React, JavaScript',
          roles: 'Nik Barbero developed this app by himself',
          learningOutcomes: 'Advanced React development skills including state management, API integration, and handling real-time pricing data. Also gained experience working with external trading card game APIs.',
          challenges: 'Integrating multiple data sources for comprehensive card information and pricing was complex. Managing API rate limits and ensuring data accuracy across different pricing sources required careful implementation.',

          learningOutcomes: 'Knowledge of implementing several APIs to create a cohesive experience as well as saving small amounts of user-specific data.',
          challenges: 'In order to allow for the favoriting of cards, I needed to learn how to save data for specific users. The solution I used was saving card-IDs to local storage and querying the API with those IDs only to display favorites.',
